@article{cite-key,
	abstract = {Laser-plasma accelerators (LPAs) produce electric fields of the order of 100 GV m−1, more than 1000 times larger than those produced by radio-frequency accelerators. These uniquely strong fields make LPAs a promising path to generate electron beams beyond the TeV, an important goal in high-energy physics. Yet, large electric fields are of little benefit if they are not maintained over a long distance. It is therefore of the utmost importance to guide the ultra-intense laser pulse that drives the accelerator. Reaching very high energies is equally useless if the properties of the electron beam change completely from shot to shot, due to the intrinsic lack of stability of the injection process. State-of-the-art laser-plasma accelerators can already address guiding and control challenges separately by tweaking the plasma structures. However, the production of beams that are simultaneously high quality and high energy has yet to be demonstrated. This paper presents a novel experiment, coupling laser-plasma waveguides and controlled injection techniques, facilitating the reliable and efficient acceleration of high-quality electron beams up to 1.1 GeV, from a 50 TW-class laser.},

   abstract = {The electron injection, for the laser wake field accelerator, controlled through the plasma density inhomogeneity is studied on a basis of analytical estimates and two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The injection scheme requires a concordance of the density scale length and laser intensity. It is shown that at a sloping inhomogeneity of plasma the wave breaking produces stronger singularity of the electron density than at a density discontinuity, but develops slower. With the help of simulations for a moderate laser intensity, we demonstrate the optimal plasma density gradient, where the electron injection into the wake wave forms the electron beam with low divergence, small energy spread and high energy. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

Beam loading manifests itself through the decrease of the beam energy, the reduction of dark current, and the increase of the energy spread for large beam charge. 3D PIC simulations are compared to the experimental results and confirm the effects of beam loading. It is found that, in our experimental conditions, the trapped electron beams generate decelerating fields on the order of 1(GV/m)/pC and that beam loading effects are optimized for trapped charges of about 20 pC. © 2009 The American Physical Society.},
